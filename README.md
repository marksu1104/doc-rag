# doc-rag

Local-first document analysis and retrieval experiments, starting with a small,
testable Python package. The first document-ingestion slice accepts UTF-8 text,
Markdown, and text-based PDFs, stores extracted source units and paragraph blocks
in a local SQLite database, and can read the stored text back. A persisted BM25
index searches one document's paragraphs and returns their exact stored text and
source locations. Optional local Qwen embeddings add exact cosine retrieval and
reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF) over the same source blocks. Generation and agent
workflows are not implemented yet.

## Development

Use Python 3.11 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run --locked doc-rag --help
uv run --locked doc-rag doctor --json
uv run --locked pytest -q
```

The `doctor` command reports only the Python, package, and SQLite versions/status.
Ingestion is explicit; importing the package does not scan documents, download
models, or initialize a database. The default database path is
`data/doc-rag.sqlite3` (ignored by Git); pass `--db` to choose another local path.

```bash
uv run --locked doc-rag ingest ./paper.pdf --language en --usage-scope personal
uv run --locked doc-rag show DOCUMENT_ID
uv run --locked doc-rag show DOCUMENT_ID --unit 1
```

PDF extraction uses pdfplumber's text layer only. Scanned pages are recorded as
having no extractable text; OCR, table reconstruction, complex reading-order
repair, and answer generation are out of scope for this parser. Extracted
page text is parser output, not a claim of faithful visual or semantic PDF
reconstruction. Do not ingest documents unless you are authorized to process
them, and keep document text and databases local. The current slice has no
document-level deletion or access-control feature; `--usage-scope` is only a
local metadata label, not an authorization check. Avoid sensitive documents
until those controls exist.

## Lexical retrieval

Build the index explicitly after ingestion, then search the returned document ID:

```bash
uv run --locked doc-rag index DOCUMENT_ID
uv run --locked doc-rag search DOCUMENT_ID "sample size" --top-k 5
uv run --locked doc-rag search DOCUMENT_ID "樣本數" --top-k 5
```

The [BM25S](https://github.com/xhluca/bm25s) index uses Lucene scoring with
`k1=1.5`, `b=0.75`, and the NumPy backend. English terms are case-folded; Han text
uses jieba search-mode segmentation with HMM disabled. Search normalization does
not change stored source text. Numbers and negations are kept, with no stopword
removal. Results contain positive-score blocks only, ordered by score then source
paragraph order. Empty or unmatched queries return an empty `hits` list.

SQLite schema v1 stores are migrated transactionally to v2 when opened. Index
snapshots live beside the database in `<database-filename>.indexes/`, which is
ignored by Git. SQLite records the active index, source fingerprint, tokenizer
and engine versions, block-ID mapping, and file checksums. A failed rebuild keeps
the previous active index. Old snapshots are retained; there is no automatic
cleanup yet. Keep the database and its index directory together when moving them.
Snapshots contain derived document vocabulary and must stay private.

Search loads a snapshot without rebuilding it. Python callers can reuse one
`BM25Retriever` and stream `search_many()` results; separate CLI invocations each
load their own snapshot. Missing, incompatible, or damaged indexes produce an
error requiring an explicit `index` command. Only use locally generated indexes.
Checksums detect accidental damage; they do not authenticate an index supplied
by someone else.

This baseline searches one document's existing paragraph blocks. It does not
translate queries, split oversized paragraphs, or match Chinese queries to
English text without shared terms. Bilingual tokenization tests do not establish
cross-language retrieval quality.

```bash
uv run --locked python scripts/benchmark_bm25.py --paragraphs 1000 --queries 50
```

The reproducible smoke benchmark generates its own English text in a temporary
directory and reports index-build time, snapshot-load time, and warm-search
p50/p95 separately. Exact marker matches verify the path works; they do not
measure real-world evidence recall. It uses no private documents or LLM.

## Semantic and hybrid retrieval

The optional `ml-cpu` extra is isolated from the core and CPU CI. The current
real-model integration uses CPU float32; GPU installation/compatibility is not
validated. It does not change system drivers or install a CUDA toolkit.

```bash
uv sync --locked --group dev --group eval --extra ml-cpu
uv run --locked doc-rag model prepare-embedding
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 uv run --locked --extra ml-cpu python scripts/embedding_smoke.py
uv run --locked --extra ml-cpu doc-rag index DOCUMENT_ID --method hybrid
uv run --locked --extra ml-cpu doc-rag search DOCUMENT_ID 'your question' --method hybrid --top-k 5
```

Model preparation is an explicit network step (~1.2 GB of weights). The
[Qwen model](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B) is pinned to revision
`97b0c614be4d77ee51c0cef4e5f07c00f9eb65b3`, with an allowlisted, hash-checked
safetensors/config/tokenizer snapshot. Model weights remain local and ignored.
Inference loads local files only, disables remote model code, and requires the
original snapshot to validate. No documents or questions are sent to a hosted API.

Queries use the model's `query` instruction; passages use no instruction. The
initial token budget is 512, overlap 64, dimensions 1024, batch size 4 and CPU
threads 6. Long passages use original-character-offset windows; cosine scores
are aggregated by maximum score per original paragraph **before** top-k. This
preserves provenance and prevents duplicate subchunks from occupying the result
list. Oversized queries are rejected, not silently truncated. These are fixed
starting settings, not optimized hyperparameters.

Dense indexes store normalized float32 vectors in `.npy`, loaded with
`allow_pickle=False` and mmap. SQLite manifests validate model/config identity,
source hashes, vector shape/checksum and segment-to-block mappings. Queries do
not rebuild indexes. An `EmbeddingEncoder` protocol allows replacing the model
without changing source storage; a different encoder requires an explicit rebuild.

Hybrid retrieves up to 20 unique paragraphs from each branch, then sums
`1 / (60 + rank)`. It never adds raw BM25 and cosine scores. Empty lexical
branches contribute nothing; ties use source order. Dense search still ranks
passages for unrelated nonempty questions: there is no calibrated relevance or
answerability threshold yet. Retrieval is not an answer-grounding guarantee.

## QASPER retrieval evaluation

Install the optional Parquet reader, explicitly prepare the public snapshot,
then evaluate locally from the repository checkout:

```bash
uv sync --locked --group dev --group eval
uv run --locked --group eval doc-rag eval download-qasper
uv run --locked --group eval doc-rag eval qasper
uv run --locked --group eval doc-rag eval qasper --resume
```

The download command fetches only the pinned train/validation Parquet files and
verifies their published SHA-256 and sizes. Evaluation reads these files offline;
it does not run remote dataset scripts or download during retrieval. PyArrow is
in the `eval` dependency group and is unnecessary for normal document search.

The baseline uses 50 train questions for development and 200 validation questions,
seed 42, selected by shuffled document order followed by question ID before
scoring. The split document IDs must be disjoint. Only nonblank `full_text`
paragraphs are indexed, with their original boundaries and coordinates preserved.
Titles, abstract fields, questions, answers, and evidence labels are not indexed.
Dataset-derived line numbers refer to reconstructed text, not PDF pages.

Evidence alignment changes whitespace only. Each evidence paragraph must match
exactly one source paragraph. An annotation containing figure/table evidence
(`FLOAT SELECTED`), unmatched text, or ambiguous matches is excluded in full.
Questions with at least one complete text annotation are eligible; the gold set
is the union of distinct paragraphs across those valid annotations. Exclusion
and annotation-issue counts cover the full source splits, including alternatives
to otherwise eligible questions. The selected subset therefore does not represent
figure/table or unanswerable-question performance.

Reports contain question-level macro evidence recall@5/@10, micro recall, complete
and partial coverage counts, per-query rankings/scores/timing, and exclusions.
This is our paragraph-retrieval protocol, not the official QASPER Answer F1 or
Evidence F1 leaderboard metric. It searches within a known paper and measures
structured-text retrieval, not PDF parsing, cross-language quality, or generated
answer correctness. Query timing excludes corpus preparation, index building,
snapshot loading, and CLI output; first-query tokenizer setup is included.

Results are under `outputs/qasper-bm25/<run-id>/`, with configuration, frozen
selection, per-question records, aggregate JSONL, and summary JSON. Input hashes,
code hashes, versions, and metric policy identify each run. Completed results are
validated and reused with `--resume`; `--resume --retry-errors` retries failures.
Recorded query failures remain in recall denominators with zero credit. Documents
are prepared/indexed once and their loaded retrievers serve all pending questions.
Existing runs are not overwritten without explicit resume.

Downloaded data, the SQLite corpus, and indexes stay local and ignored. Public
benchmark files contain identifiers, metrics, and provenance only. See
[the frozen BM25 baseline](benchmarks/qasper-bm25/README.md) for measured results.

Run the same selected questions through BM25, dense and hybrid with one loaded
model and shared persisted document indexes:

```bash
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 uv run --locked --extra ml-cpu --group eval python scripts/qasper_comparison.py
# Repeat the same run without executing completed questions:
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 uv run --locked --extra ml-cpu --group eval python scripts/qasper_comparison.py --resume
```

The comparison keeps seed 42, 50 development questions, 200 validation questions,
the evidence-alignment policy and selection checksum fixed. Each method has a
separate run ID and records its configuration. It reports single/multiple/three-or-more
evidence coverage as well as overall recall. Compare results at the same k; these
overlapping groups are diagnostics, not independent samples. Dense/hybrid query
latency includes query embedding; build time includes document embedding. Shared
indexes are built once; hybrid's reused indexing cost is not evidence that
embedding preparation is free. No query translation or reranking is included.
See [the frozen comparison](benchmarks/qasper-retrieval/README.md) for measured
gains, multi-evidence regressions and CPU preparation costs.
The CLI loads a model once per invocation; do not start a separate CLI process
for every question in a batch. Use the comparison script or reuse one encoder
and retriever through the Python API.

For individual runs, `doc-rag eval qasper --method dense` or `--method hybrid`
accepts the same model/token settings as index/search. Use `--output-dir` for
separate experiments and optionally `--index-db` for a shared local corpus.
